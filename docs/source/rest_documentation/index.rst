REST Documentation
==================

During development it is useful to have API documentation, showing all of the
supported endpoints and parameters.

After logging in to the Piccolo admin, you can go to ``/api/docs`` to
see `Swagger docs <https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui>`_, or
``/api/redoc`` to see `Redoc docs <https://github.com/Redocly/redoc>`_ for the
API.

.. hint:: As of version 0.14.0, Swagger interactive features work with all HTTP methods.
